We use the #timeout Slack channel to keep each other updated on our availability.

As an outcome driven organisation, we assume that everyone is working on achieving their goals, unless notified otherwise.

If you’re going to be away for longer than half a day, are away ill, or are on holiday, please add a short status update to the channel. Your update should be a line or two, stating why you’re away, how long you expect to be away, and when you expect to be back. A couple of examples include:

- I’m unfortunately ill today, but I may be available later this afternoon 🤒
- Away on holiday through to 20th December 🏖

Please don’t kick off a thread or add any other messages to the channel to keep it noise free, but reacting via emojis is totally fine! Please use Slack’s sharing feature if you may want to discuss a given status message by sharing it in another channel or direct message.

We currently do not have a formal mechanism to track paid time off, but will introduce something in the near future!
