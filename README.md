# Nomod Way
The [Nomod Way][1] is detailed guide about how we run our business at Nomod! This is the central repository of our collective knowledge. It is always changing and is open to anyone to contribute to, or fork and use for their own purposes.

## How to Install Locally
The Nomod Way is built with [Gatsby][2], an incredibly nice, fast, static site generator.
The best way to get up and running is to install it locally. Gatsby's [documentation is the best place to get started][3], or alternatively use the instructions below:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine

2. Install the Gatsby-CLI by running `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

3. Navigate to your repo directory and run `npm install`

To get a development server up and running:

1. Run `gatsby develop`

2. Boom, you're up! Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment of the Nomod Way at https://localhost:8000

## Building for Production & Deployment
1. Run `gatsby build`

2. To serve the production build locally, run `gatsby serve` and Gatsby will start a local production server for testing at https://localhost:9000

3. To deploy into production, commit or merge into the `master` branch. Netlify, which is where we're hosted, will automatically pick up the changes and will kick off a new build!

## Categories & Subcategories
The Nomod Way is organised into eight (8) categories and numerous subcategories.

A category is defined with the following properties in a markdown file:

```
---
templateKey: category-post
title: Company
description: About Nomod, our values, our culture, how we communicate, and, how
  we manage the Nomod Way
order: 1
--- 
````

A subcategory is defined with the following properties in a markdown file:

```
---
templateKey: subcategory-post
title: About
articleCategory: Company
subCategoryName: About
order: 1
---
```

In both cases, the `order` property is defined as an integer where a lower value will place the category or subcategory in a higher position than a lower integer value

Category files are named `category.md`, whilst subcategory files are named `category-subcategory.md`

## Articles
An article contains the content for a given topic. Any number of articles can be created under a given category and subcategory.

An article is defined with the following properties at the top of a markdown file:

```
templateKey: article-post
title: About Nomod
articleCategory: Company
articleSubCategory: About
order: 1
````
The contents of the article should follow. 

### Images
Images are supported and can be added to an article by being uploaded to `/static/uploads` and then adding a standard image link to your markdown file: 

```
![digital banking is already upon us](/uploads/yourimage.jpg)`
````

Images should be used sparingly and only to enhance text with diagrams or to better express the content rather to share images for the sake of it. The intent of the Nomod Way remains to be a generally text heavy, highly referenceable, everyday working guide on how we run our business
