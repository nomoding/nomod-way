# How we build Product

### Our high level product process

The things that we need to do to go from Spec to Shipped:

1. Write down a description of the feature in our spec document
2. Break down the feature into user stories on Clubhouse
3. Amalgamate user stories under Epics
4. Create and assign a milestone for a given Epic
5. Build the user stories to complete the Epic
6. Test the Epic through multiple builds
7. Report any bugs via X
8. Test fixes
9. Ship

### WIP

1. Each product has a specification document located in the Product Shared Drive
2.
